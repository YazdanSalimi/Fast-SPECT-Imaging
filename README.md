# Fast-SPECT-Imaging
## Deep Learning pipeline for fast SPECT imaging.
It contrains the trained models for multiple tracers for brain SPECT and other applications.
## Models:
Please downlowd the trained models for each task and give the path on your machine where you saved the models to the inference function. 
- [Brain DatScan I123](https://doi.org/10.26037/yareta:z37sdseqrra4ziesaoovdyomba). This models are trained to convert a three minute I123-ioflupane brain images to a standard 15 minutes scan.
Inferece example is provided. Please check the SNMMI [abstract](https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/65/supplement_2/241761.abstract) for more information.
